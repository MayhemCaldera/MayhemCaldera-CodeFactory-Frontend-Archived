    <h1>Toto - Africa </h1>
    <div>
        <p> 
            <div>I hear the drums echoing tonight</div>
            <div>But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation</div>
            <div>She's coming in, 12:30 flight</div>
            <div>The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation</div>
            <div>I stopped an old man along the way</div>
            <div>Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies</div>
            <div>He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"</div>
                       
            
            
            
            
            </p>

    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>
            It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
            <br>
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa
<br>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
<p>
    The wild dogs cry out in the night
    <br>
As they grow restless, 
<br>
longing for some solitary company
<br>
I know that I must do what's right
<br>
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises 
<br>
like Olympus above the Serengeti
<br>
I seek to cure what's deepâ€¦
</p>
    </div>
